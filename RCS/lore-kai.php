                                        <p><span class="dropcap-bg">H</span>is mother named him <em>Kai</em>, because his striking blue eyes reminded her of the sea. It was while out at sea that Kai's mother first met his father. His father had been a college student at the time, who was spending his senior year studying abroad in Japan. The stars aligned and the two met by chance while sea kayaking around the Kerama Islands. Although Kai's father hailed from the United States of America and his mother was native to Japan, the two shared an intense passion for seaside adventures and were consequently married within the year. The two decided to live in Japan.</p>    

<p>Kai enjoys honoring both his parents' cultural heritages. Although trained in the martial arts and a sharp swordsman, Kai can be spotted recklessly swinging around his ancestral katana and inadvertently breaking things around his house and downtown Tokyo (much to his mother's dismay). Moreover, Kai also plans to visit his relatives in Texas sometime in the near future, where he hopes to acquire and an authentic Texan accent and say the word "y'all" (much to his father's dismay). </p>

<p>With mischievous blue eyes, Kai is similar to a cat in the sense that he always lands on his feet. Although he comes across as laidback and easygoing, Kai is more complicated than initial impressions may convey. As an overeager explorer, Kai enjoys trailblazing the unknown path. He is not afraid to step outside of his normal comfort zone. Kai also enjoys taking charge of situations, even if he has no idea what is going on. Kai is usually accompanied by his panther, Minoru, who Kai considers to be his spirit animal. Minoru has yet to confirm if he is indeed a real spirit animal.</p> 

<p>As a skilled hunter and tracker, Kai makes a strong ally. He knows how to efficiently depend on nature for basic survival and has a keen eye for detail. Learning to tread silently out in the wild, Kai is particularly skilled in sneaking up on unsuspecting entities and also navigating silently through the kitchen to sneak late night snacks. A natural charmer, Kai is notoriously clever with his words. He has been known to talk hours about, well, nothing. Kai utilizes his quick wit to untangle himself and his allies from complicated situations. No matter what trouble he may find himself in, Kai always finds a way out. Kai's mother thinks her clever son may be a mythical trickster.</p>

<p>As the chibi representative of the RCS Hearthstone division, Kai is pleased to represent a game that involves collecting things. It provides him an excellent opportunity to put his light-fingered skills to use. Actually, in all honesty, Kai wanted the RCS Hearthstone position because he knew Sir M really wanted it (who was bitter about it for a while, but is now happy to represent <em>Retracted</em>)</p> 

<p>Kai is yet to be bested in a Hearthstone match, and seeks worthy opponents. However, eager challengers beware! Kai ends up being the only player waging war with 52 cards in a deck of 30 cards (and most of those cards are Legendary cards). In short, he has a few extra cards up his kimono. Although Minoru attempts to keep him straight, Kai follows the branch of philosophy which espouses "victory erases all dishonor."</p> 

<p>Kai is currently living at an undisclosed location somewhere in the Japanese countryside. He keeps in close touch with his cousin Lauren Spark wherever she may be. </p>
